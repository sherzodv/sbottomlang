Defining feature set and syntax:
  powerful state of the art type system with proof assistent expressiveness
  easy readable syntax suitable for "value"
  best tooling

current backend:
  golang

function levels:
  def: typelevel function, body runs at compile time to form a type
  gen: macrolevel function, body runs at compile time to manipulate ast
  fun: runtime level function, ordinary function, body runs at runtime to perform actual work

engineering:
  infrustructural abstractions ?
    distributed computations
    code hash control ?

type system:
  subtyping
  structural types
  dependent types
  higher order types
  session types ?
  linar types ?
  totality control

effects:
  fully expressible in type system
  rich effects library
  algebraic effects?

syntax features:
  multi-clause functions
  dot notation / method chaining
  uniform function call
  scala like string interpolators
  
modules:
  file system bound?
  open syntax (header)
  no intersections
  
tooling:
  rich std (scala)
  lsp
  ides: 
    vscode
    idea
    vim
    emacs
  build system:
    should be fast (both start & run)
    allow code level packages
    reproducible builds
    modularity and extensibility
